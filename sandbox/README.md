### Next Step

Create environment:
1. Make some more deep research about environments
2. write everything we will need for our environment, like main things as action_space and obs_space.
3. make it compatible with gym, implementing 4 core methods and check how to instance and install it locally
4. test it with agents (PARL DQN | baselines ACER,A2C,DQN)

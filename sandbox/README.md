# This directory to make random stuff

### Actual Step
Testing environment


### Next Step (already made)

Create environment:
1. Make some more deep research about environments
2. write everything we will need for our environment, like main things as action_space and obs_space.
3. make it compatible with gym, implementing 4 core methods and check how to instance and install it locally
4. test it with agents (PARL DQN | baselines ACER,A2C,DQN)

## Environment:
- Simulation
- State vector
- Reward System
- action space

First make the environment example, Then add the reward and state vector system.
can either be graphic or not.


## Agent:

- Stable Baselines
- PARL
        - in sight, chinese framework

## Algorithms:

- DQN 
- PPO 
        - Proximal Policy Optimizaiton
